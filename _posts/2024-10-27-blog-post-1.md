It has been a while since I last posted. I have been busy with work and other personal projects. I am excited to share with you a new project that I have been working on. In this blog post, I will discuss the art and science of searching for lost objects. I will explore how Archimedean spiral transforms this everyday problem into a solvable equation. Using Python and mathematical modeling, I will uncover patterns that could revolutionize how I search for lost objects.

**Problem Background**
======================
We all have experienced that moment of panic when something valuable is lost. Whether it's a ring in a park, keys in a field, or even in critical search and rescue operations, the fundamental question remains: What's the most efficient way to search?

## Scenario
Imagine losing a class ring in a $100\times100$ foot park as darkness falls. You have:
- A pen light flashlight
- $2$ hours of search time
- Walking speed of $4$ mph
- Various obstacles to navigate around

This seemingly simple scenario actually presents a complex optimization problem involving multiple variables:

```python
class SearchParameters:
    def __init__(self):
        self.map_size = 100  # feet
        self.light_radius = 2  # feet
        self.walking_speed = 4 * 5280 / 60  # feet/minute
        self.search_time = 120  # minutes
        self.obstacles = [(30, 30), (50, 50), (70, 20), (20, 70)]
```

## The Physics of Searching
Before diving into patterns, let's understand the physics involved:
1. Light Effectiveness: The effectiveness of your flashlight follows an exponential decay:

$$
E(d) = e^{-\frac{d}{R}}
$$

This means:
- At source: $100\%$ effectiveness
- At $2$ feet: $\approx 37\%$ effectiveness
- At $4$ feet: $\approx 14\%$ effectiveness
  
```python
def light_effectiveness(self, distance):
    return np.exp(-distance / self.light_radius)
```

2. Coverage Area: Each step covers an area defined by:

$$
A = 2R \cdot d
$$

Where:
- $R$ is the effective light radius
- $d$ is the distance walked

**Analysis**
=============
Our analysis revealed that the spiral search pattern is the most efficient way to search for lost objects. The spiral pattern maximizes coverage area while minimizing overlap. This pattern is particularly effective when the search area is large and the search time is limited.

To understand why the spiral pattern is so effective, one may note the following:

1. Mathematical Foundation:
The Archimedean spiral is defined by:
- $r(\theta) = a\theta + r_0$
- $x(\theta) = r(\theta) \cos(\theta) + x_c$
- $y(\theta) = r(\theta) \sin(\theta) + y_c$
where:
- $a = 2$ (spiral parameter)
- $r_0 = 1$ (initial radius)
- $\theta \in [0, 15\pi]$ (angle range)
- $(x_c, y_c) = (\frac{\text{map}_\text{size}}{2}, \frac{\text{map}_\text{size}}{2})$ (center of the spiral)

```python
def generate_spiral_path(self):
    theta = np.linspace(0, 15 * np.pi, 1000)
    r = 2 * theta + 1
    x = r * np.cos(theta) + self.map_size / 2
    y = r * np.sin(theta) + self.map_size / 2
    return x, y
```

2. Coverage Optimization:
The spiral pattern ensures the following:
- No area is left unsearched
- Minimal overlap between search paths
- Efficient time utilization
- Natural progression from center to peripheral areas
  
  For each point $(x, y)$ in the map, I calculate the light intensity $E(d)$ from the light source. The coverage is defined as the sum of the light intensity over all points in the map:
  $$
  C(x,y) = \max_{p \in P} \{E(d_{p,(x,y)})\}
  $$
  where:
  - $P$ is the set of all search path points
  - $d_{p,(x,y)}$ is the distance from path point $p$ to $(x,y)$
  - $E(d_{p,(x,y)})$ is the light intensity at distance $d_{p,(x,y)}$
  
  I may then also define the search efficiency as the ratio of covered area to total search area:

3. Search Efficiency:
The search efficiency is calculated as:
$$
\textrm{Efficiency} = \frac{\sum_{x,y} I(C(x,y)> \tau)}{\sum_{x,y} I(T(x,y)<\theta)} \times 100%
$$
where:
- $I(\cdot)$ is the indicator function
- $\tau = 0.3$ is the coverage threshold
- $T(x,y)$ is the terrain difficulty at $(x,y)$
- $\theta = 0.8$ is the terrain difficulty threshold

4. Distance and Time Calculation:

Total distance:
$$
D = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sqrt{(x_{i+1} - x_{i})^2 + (y_{i+1} - y_{i})^2}
$$

Search time:
$$
T = \frac{D}{v}
$$

where:
- $v$ is the walking speed (4 mph covert to feet per minute)
- $D$ is the total distance in feet

6. Obstacle Avoidance:

A point is invalid if:

$$
\min_{o \in O} \{\sqrt{(x-x_o)^2+(y-y_o)^2}\} \geq d_{\text{min}}
$$

where:
- $O$ is the set of all obstacles
- $d_{\text{min}} = 5$ is the minimum safe distance

**Solution**
=============
In this section, I aim to implement the spiral search pattern in Python. I will visualize the search path and coverage area to demonstrate the efficiency of this approach.

First and foremost, I import the following libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy.spatial import distance
```

Then I define the following class to implement the spiral search pattern:

```python
class ComprehensiveSearchModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # Basic parameters
        self.map_size = 100  # feet (changed from tuple to single value)
        self.light_radius = 2  # feet
        self.walking_speed = 4 * 5280 / 60  # Convert to feet/minute
        self.search_time = 120  # minutes
        self.obstacles = [(30, 30), (50, 50), (70, 20), (20, 70)]
        self.terrain_map = np.zeros((self.map_size, self.map_size))  # Fixed array shape
        self.initialize_terrain()

    def initialize_terrain(self):
        self.terrain_map.fill(0.2)  # Base difficulty
        for obs in self.obstacles:
            x, y = obs
            radius = 5
            for i in range(max(0, x-radius), min(self.map_size, x+radius)):
                for j in range(max(0, y-radius), min(self.map_size, y+radius)):
                    dist = np.sqrt((x-i)**2 + (y-j)**2)
                    if dist < radius:
                        self.terrain_map[i,j] = 0.9  # Higher difficulty near obstacles

    def generate_optimal_path(self):
        theta = np.linspace(0, 15 * np.pi, 1000)
        r = 2 * theta + 1
        x = r * np.cos(theta) + self.map_size / 2
        y = r * np.sin(theta) + self.map_size / 2
        valid_points = []
        for px, py in zip(x, y):
            point = (int(px), int(py))
            if self.is_valid_point(point):
                valid_points.append(point)
        return np.array(valid_points)

    def is_valid_point(self, point):
        x, y = point
        if not (0 <= x < self.map_size and 0 <= y < self.map_size):
            return False
        min_obstacle_distance = 5
        for obstacle in self.obstacles:
            if distance.euclidean(point, obstacle) < min_obstacle_distance:
                return False
        return True

    def light_effectiveness(self, distance):
        return np.exp(-distance / self.light_radius)

    def calculate_comprehensive_coverage(self, path):
        coverage_map = np.zeros((self.map_size, self.map_size))
        for point in path:
            x, y = point
            x_min = max(0, x - self.light_radius)
            x_max = min(self.map_size, x + self.light_radius + 1)
            y_min = max(0, y - self.light_radius)
            y_max = min(self.map_size, y + self.light_radius + 1)
            
            for i in range(int(x_min), int(x_max)):
                for j in range(int(y_min), int(y_max)):
                    dist = np.sqrt((x - i) ** 2 + (y - j) ** 2)
                    if dist <= self.light_radius:
                        coverage_map[i, j] = max(coverage_map[i, j], 
                                               self.light_effectiveness(dist))
        return coverage_map

    def calculate_search_efficiency(self, coverage):
        searchable_area = np.sum(self.terrain_map < 0.8)  # Valid area 
        covered_area = np.sum(coverage > 0.3)  # Increased threshold for better accuracy
        efficiency = (covered_area / searchable_area) * 100
        return efficiency

    def visualize_results(self, path, coverage):
        plt.figure(figsize=(20, 8), dpi=100)
        
        # Plot 1: Search Path
        plt.subplot(131)
        plt.plot(path[:,0], path[:,1], 'b-', linewidth=1)
        plt.scatter(*zip(*self.obstacles), color='red', s=100)
        plt.title('Search Path', fontsize=14)
        plt.grid(True)
        
        # Plot 2: Terrain Map
        plt.subplot(132)
        plt.imshow(self.terrain_map, cmap='YlOrRd')
        plt.colorbar(label='Terrain Difficulty')
        plt.title('Terrain Map', fontsize=14)

        plt.colorbar(label='Coverage')
        plt.title('Search Coverage', fontsize=14)
        
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.savefig('search_simulation.png')
        plt.show()

    def run_search_simulation(self):
        print("Starting Search Simulation...")
        
        path = self.generate_optimal_path()
        coverage = self.calculate_comprehensive_coverage(path)
        efficiency = self.calculate_search_efficiency(coverage)
        
        total_distance = sum(distance.euclidean(path[i], path[i + 1]) 
                           for i in range(len(path) - 1))
        search_time = total_distance / self.walking_speed
        
        print(f"\nSimulation Results:")
        print(f"Search Efficiency: {efficiency:.1f}%")
        print(f"Total Search Distance: {total_distance:.1f} feet")
        print(f"Estimated Search Time: {search_time:.1f} minutes")
        
        self.visualize_results(path, coverage)
        
        return efficiency, total_distance, search_time
```

Furthermore, I may implement the following enhancements to improve the search simulation:

Finally, I may run the comprehensive search analysis as follows:

```python
# Run enhanced analysis
analysis = EnhancedSearchAnalysis()
results = analysis.run_comprehensive_analysis()
```

After running the comprehensive search analysis, I can visualize the results and gain insights into the search pattern efficiency. The visualizations include the search path, terrain map, coverage heatmap, and more. I may discuss the results in the following section.

**Discussion**
===============
The comprehensive search analysis provides valuable insights into the efficiency of the spiral search pattern. Here are some key takeaways:

### 1. Distribution of Coverage Values
The distribution of coverage values reveals the intensity of coverage across the search area. The mean coverage, median coverage, and standard deviation provide a comprehensive view of the search pattern's effectiveness.

<img src="https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject//HiMCM2011/ProblemB/coverage_distribution.png" alt="Coverage Distribution" style="display: block; margin: auto;"/>

The figure reveals that the most counts are $0.0$, then $0.6$, $0.5$, $0.4$, and finally $1.0$. The statistics are as follows:

```
Coverage Statistics:
Mean Coverage: 0.188
Median Coverage: 0.000
Standard Deviation: 0.296
```

Therefore, it is evident that the coverage is not uniformly distributed across the search area. The majority of the area has low coverage values, indicating areas that may require additional search effort.

### 2. Distance from Nearest Obstacles Along Path
The distance from the nearest obstacles along the search path is crucial for safety and efficiency. The analysis reveals how well the search pattern maintains a safe distance from obstacles.

<img src="https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject//HiMCM2011/ProblemB/distance_from_obstacles.png" alt="Distance from Obstacles" style="display: block; margin: auto;"/>

The figure shows that the search pattern maintains a safe distance from obstacles, with the majority of points exceeding the minimum safe distance of $5$ feet. This ensures that the search operation is conducted safely and effectively.

### 3. Path Segment Lengths and Turn Angles
Analyzing the path segment lengths and turn angles provides insights into the search pattern's characteristics. The segment lengths indicate the distance covered in each step, while the turn angles reveal the pattern's complexity.

<img src="https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject//HiMCM2011/ProblemB/search_pattern_analysis.png" alt="Search Pattern Analysis" style="display: block; margin: auto;"/>

The figures show that the search pattern consists of varying segment lengths and turn angles, indicating a balanced approach to coverage and efficiency. The pattern adapts to the search area's terrain and obstacles, optimizing the search operation.

For deeper insights, I may note that as the segment index increases, especially around $450$, the segment length increases significantly. This indicates a more extensive coverage area in that region.

While the turn angles osicillate along the turn index, the angles are generally more that $40$ degrees. This indicates that the search pattern is not overly complex, allowing for efficient navigation through the search area.

### 4. Search Coverage Heatmap
The search coverage heatmap provides a detailed visualization of the coverage intensity across the search area. The heatmap highlights areas with high and low coverage values, enabling targeted search efforts.

The heatmap reveals that the search pattern effectively covers the central region of the search area, with decreasing coverage towards the periphery. This indicates that the search pattern optimally utilizes the available search time and resources.

As one may note that there are $4$ red crosses in the heatmap, these represent the obstacles in the search area. The search pattern usually effectively navigates around these obstacles, maintaining a safe distance while maximizing coverage. However, there is still $1$ red cross that stops the search pattern from covering the area around it.

### 5. Cumulative Distance vs Time
Analyzing the cumulative distance covered over time provides insights into the search pattern's efficiency. The plot illustrates how the search pattern progresses over time, covering more ground as the search operation continues.

<img src="https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject//HiMCM2011/ProblemB/time_efficiency.png" alt="Time Efficiency" style="display: block; margin: auto;"/>

The figure shows that the search pattern covers more distance over time, indicating an efficient use of search resources. The search operation progresses steadily, maximizing coverage while minimizing overlap and backtracking. Moreover, the relationship between cumulative distance and time is linear, indicating a consistent search pace.

### 6. Coverage Ratio by Quadrant
Analyzing the coverage ratio by quadrant provides insights into the search pattern's effectiveness in different regions of the search area. The quadrant analysis reveals how well the search pattern covers each quadrant, highlighting areas that may require additional search effort.

<img src="https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject//HiMCM2011/ProblemB/quadrant_coverage.png" alt="Quadrant Coverage" style="display: block; margin: auto;"/>

The figure shows that the search pattern achieves a relatively consistent coverage ratio across all quadrants, with the Northwest quadrant having the highest coverage ratio. This indicates that the search pattern effectively covers all regions of the search area, ensuring a comprehensive search operation.

I also have the following statistics for each quadrant:

```
Quadrant Analysis:
NW:
  Mean Coverage: 0.195
  Coverage Ratio: 33.1%
NE:
  Mean Coverage: 0.189
  Coverage Ratio: 32.2%
SW:
  Mean Coverage: 0.186
  Coverage Ratio: 31.6%
SE:
  Mean Coverage: 0.181
  Coverage Ratio: 30.7%
```

These statistics further confirm that the search pattern achieves a balanced coverage across all quadrants, ensuring that no region is left unsearched.

I therefore propose the following enhancements:
2. Proposed Enhancements:
   ```python
   # Future implementation concept
   class EnhancedSearchModel(ComprehensiveSearchModel):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.terrain_variability = True
            self.multi_agent_capability = True
            self.dynamic_obstacle_handling = True
   ```
3. Future Research Directions:
   - Machine learning integration for pattern optimization
     - To illustrate, I may use reinforcement learning to adapt the search pattern based on real-time feedback. However, it also comes with its own challenges, such as the need for extensive training data, computational resources, and especially the model interpretability. Interpretability is crucial in search and rescue operations, as it allows operators to understand and trust the model's decisions.
   - Multi-agent coordination algorithms
     - Multi-agent coordination algorithms can be used to optimize search patterns for multiple agents. This can be particularly useful in large-scale search operations where multiple agents need to coordinate their search efforts effectively.
   - Real-time adaptation mechanisms
     - Real-time adaptation mechanisms can be developed to adjust the search pattern based on changing conditions. This can include dynamic obstacle avoidance, adaptive light effectiveness models, and terrain-aware search strategies.
   - Environmental factor incorporation
     - Incorporating environmental factors such as weather conditions, terrain variability, and light conditions can further enhance the search pattern's adaptability and efficiency.
