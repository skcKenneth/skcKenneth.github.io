This post presents my comprehensive mathematical modeling framework for optimizing NYC's Citi Bike system expansion. Through an integrated approach combining advanced forecasting, multi-objective optimization, and systems thinking, I transformed a fragmented planning challenge into a cohesive decision-support system that dramatically improves both operational performance and policy outcomes.

BUT DO NOT take it too seriously. This is a fictional blog post created for illustrative purposes, showcasing how complex urban planning challenges can be addressed through sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques.

## Problem Background

Citi Bike is the largest bike-share system in the United States, recording $35$ million rides in $2023$ across approximately $36,000$ bikes and $2,100$ stations. In $2024$, Citi Bike and its operator Lyft partnered with NYC DOT to launch a major expansion, aiming to increase service coverage while maintaining operational efficiency and environmental sustainability.

This expansion will introduce over $5,000$ new bikes and $300$ additional stations, with a focus on underserved neighborhoods and high-demand areas. Strategic placement of new stations is intended to ensure equitable access and minimize costs. A significant portion of the new fleet will be e-bikes, which present unique operational challenges due to battery life and charging requirements. The goal is to balance the fleet to meet diverse rider needs while keeping costs manageable.

Funding for the expansion comes from fare increases, including an annual pass now priced at $219.99$, e-bike usage at $0.20$ per minute, and a single-ride unlock fee of $4.79$. The plan is to grow the fleet to $40,000$ bikes (half of which will be e-bikes) and over $2,000$ stations, with the build-out supported by these recent fare hikes.

Rapid growth brings four interconnected challenges:

- **Demand Forecasting:** Daily ridership continues to break records (e.g., $4.07$ million trips in August $2023$), requiring accurate prediction of future demand.
- **Station Siting & Capacity:** Many docks are full or empty during peak times, leading to rider frustration and operational inefficiencies.
- **Fleet Rebalancing & E-bike Charging:** E-bike batteries require frequent swaps—about every $45$ minutes during heavy use—necessitating efficient rebalancing and charging logistics.
- **Pricing & Equity:** Higher fees must recover costs without deterring ridership or disproportionately impacting low-income users.

**Your Tasks:**
- Predict hourly demand for every station in $2026$ following the planned expansion.
- Select $300$ new station locations (and dock counts) to maximize service coverage within a specified capital budget.
- Design an operational rebalancing schedule (trucks + in-field battery swaps) that minimizes unmet demand and dead-heading mileage.
- Recommend a dynamic pricing scheme that achieves a $150$ million revenue target for $2026$ while keeping the Gini index of mobility access below $0.3$.
- Evaluate environmental benefits ($\operatorname{CO}_2$ avoided) and system resilience under extreme weather scenarios.


### The Fragmentation Problem

In most cities, including New York, these questions have been handled separately. Planners build models to predict demand, then use those predictions to pick station locations. Someone else schedules truck routes to move bikes. A third group sets prices. Finally, others estimate environmental impact. This “siloed” approach often leads to good results for one aspect but creates new problems elsewhere.

For example:
- **Adding stations in high-demand areas** might reduce empty stations but could increase rebalancing costs if those stations become overcrowded.
- **Raising prices** might increase revenue, but could reduce ridership, especially among low-income users.
- **More stations** might mean better coverage, but add maintenance burdens and capital costs.

In short, optimizing one piece of the system can unintentionally harm another. The real challenge is to **integrate all these decisions**—using data, simulation, and optimization—so the whole system works better, not just its parts.

### Why This Matters for New York

Citi Bike is a public-private partnership with a mandate to balance profitability, accessibility, and sustainability. Without coordinated optimization, system growth could falter: stations may go underused, users may become frustrated, and costs could balloon. Conversely, a system that strikes the right balance can serve more people, reduce city congestion, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and remain affordable and resilient under pressure.

## Executive Summary

**The Challenge**: NYC's $35$-million-ride Citi Bike system needed expansion optimization across five interconnected dimensions: demand prediction, station placement, bike rebalancing, pricing strategy, and environmental impact assessment.

**The Solution**: An integrated mathematical framework using interpretable machine learning, evolutionary optimization, and operations research techniques.

**The Results**:  
- **$150\%$ improvement** in demand forecasting accuracy ($\operatorname{R}^2$ from $0.260$ to $0.850+$)
- **$15,000–40,000$ additional people** served through optimal station placement
- **\$25–\$75 cost per person covered** vs. previous undefined metrics
- **$79+$ tonnes $\operatorname{CO}_2$** prevented annually through system optimization

## Comprehensive Methodology

### 1. Advanced Demand Forecasting

**The Breakthrough**: Instead of treating forecasting as a pure machine learning problem, I approached it as an urban systems challenge requiring interpretable features that planners could understand and trust.

#### Feature Engineering Innovations

**Cyclical Temporal Encoding**: Converting time variables into trigonometric components to capture periodic patterns:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{hour}_\mathrm{sin} &= \sin(2 \pi \times \text{hour} / 24) \\
\text{hour}_\mathrm{cos} &= \cos(2 \pi \times \text{hour} / 24)
\end{align*}
$$

This helps models understand that $11$ PM and $1$ AM are only two hours apart, not $22$ units.

**Multi-Scale Lag Features**: Incorporating demand patterns at multiple time horizons:
- **Short-term**: 1–3 hours (immediate patterns)
- **Daily**: 24 hours (day-of-week effects)  
- **Weekly**: 168 hours (weekly routines)

**Weather Interaction Terms**: Capturing context-dependent weather effects:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{temp}_\mathrm{weekend} &= \text{temp}_\mathrm{normalized} \times \text{is}_\mathrm{weekend} \\
\text{temp}_\mathrm{hour} &= \text{temp}_\mathrm{normalized} \times \text{hour}_\mathrm{sin}
\end{align*}
$$

**Station-Specific Modeling**: Training separate Random Forest models for each station to capture local behavioral patterns—subway stations behave differently from park or office locations.

**Technical Implementation**:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor(
n_estimators=100,
max_depth=15,
min_samples_split=5,
random_state=42
)

```

**Results**: Achieved **$R^2 > 0.85$** across 85% of stations, with feature importance analysis revealing that weather and temporal cyclical features contributed 65% of forecasting accuracy.

### 2. Multi-Objective Station Location Optimization

#### Mathematical Formulation

**Bi-Objective Problem**:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Objectives:} \\
&\quad \max_{x} \; f_1(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{population}_i \cdot \text{coverage\_indicator}_i(x) \\
&\quad \min_{x} \; f_2(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{station\_cost}_j \cdot x_j \\[1em]
&\text{Subject to:} \\
&\quad \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{station\_cost}_j \cdot x_j \leq \text{Budget\_total} \\
&\quad \text{coverage\_indicator}_i(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } \exists j \text{ such that } x_j = 1 \text{ and } \text{distance}_{ij} \leq 750\,\text{m} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases} \\
&\quad x_j \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall j \in \{1, \ldots, M\}
\end{align*}
$$

#### PyMOO NSGA-II Implementation

**Algorithm Configuration**:
- **Population size**: 100 individuals for solution diversity
- **Generations**: 100 iterations for convergence
- **Crossover**: Simulated Binary Crossover (η = 20)
- **Mutation**: Polynomial Mutation (η = 25)

**Coverage Function**: Station j covers population point i if walking distance ≤ 750m:


$$
\text{distance}_{ij} = \sqrt{\left[(\text{lat}_i - \text{lat}_j)² + (\text{lon}_i - \text{lon}_j)²\right]} \times 111,000
$$

**Key Innovation**: Instead of one “optimal” solution, the algorithm produces a Pareto front of trade-offs, enabling planners to choose based on policy priorities.

**Performance**: Optimal solutions serve **$15,000–40,000$** people with **cost efficiency of $25–$75 per person covered**.

### 3. Predictive Rebalancing Optimization

#### From Reactive to Predictive

**Traditional Approach**: Wait for stations to become empty/full, then dispatch trucks at $\$80$/hour.

**Predictive Framework**: Use demand forecasts to anticipate imbalances:

```python
def calculate_rebalancing_need(station_id, forecast, capacity):
    target_occupancy = capacity * 0.6
    if forecast > capacity * 0.7:  # Deficit station
        return -(forecast - target_occupancy)
    elif forecast < capacity * 0.3:  # Surplus station
        return target_occupancy - forecast
    return 0  # Balanced
```

#### Vehicle Routing Optimization

**Priority-Based Assignment**:
1. **High-priority**: Severe imbalances affecting major ridership
2. **Medium-priority**: Moderate imbalances with remaining truck capacity
3. **Low-priority**: Preventive moves during off-peak hours

**Efficiency Metrics**:

$$
\operatorname{system\_efficiency} = \Sigma(\mathrm{bikes\_moved\_k}) / \Sigma(\mathrm{distance\_k})
$$

**Results**: Achieved **$0.3–0.8$ bikes per kilometer efficiency** with **$15–50$ bikes moved per operation**.

---

### 4. Dynamic Pricing with Equity Constraints

#### Multi-Objective Pricing Framework

**Objectives**:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Maximize:} \quad \text{Revenue} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{price}_i \times \text{demand}_i(\text{price}_i) \\
&\text{Minimize:} \quad \text{Inequity} = \operatorname{Gini}(\text{monthly\_costs}) \\
&\text{Subject to:} \\
&\quad \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{price}_i \times \text{demand}_i(\text{price}_i) \geq \$150{,}000{,}000 \\
&\quad \operatorname{Gini}(\text{monthly\_costs}) \leq 0.30 \\
&\quad \text{price}_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i
\end{align*}
$$

**Demand Response Model**:

$$
\text{demand}_i(\text{price}_i) = \text{base\_demand}_i \times \left(\frac{\text{price}_i}{\text{current\_price}_i}\right)^{\text{elasticity}_i}
$$

**Equity Constraint**: Maintain **Gini coefficient ≤ 0.30** for accessibility costs.

#### Elasticity Estimation

**Natural Experiment Approach**: Using weekday vs. weekend usage patterns to estimate price sensitivity, since weekend riders face different "time costs".

**Implementation**: `Pymoo NSGA-II` with constraint handling for revenue targets and equity thresholds.

**Results**: Pricing strategies achieve **revenue targets** while maintaining **equitable access across income levels**.

---

### 5. Environmental Impact Assessment

#### Conservative Calculation Framework

**Trip Substitution Analysis**:

$$
\text{CO₂\_savings} = \text{annual\_trips} \times \text{substitution\_rate} \times \text{avg\_distance} \times \text{emission\_factor}
$$

Where:

- $\text{annual\_trips}$: Extrapolated from demand forecasts
- $\text{substitution\_rate}$: $0.6$ (conservative $60\%$ car replacement)
- $\text{avg\_distance}$: $2.3$ km per trip (system average)
- $\text{emission\_factor}$: $0.255$ kg $\text{CO}_2$/km (NYC average car)


**Temporal Weighting**: Rush-hour bike trips more likely to replace car trips than weekend leisure rides.

**Results**: System prevents **$79+ \text{tonnes} \; \text{CO}_2$** annually, equivalent to **removing dozens of cars** from NYC roads.

## Results Visualization and Analysis

The integrated mathematical modeling framework generated extensive visualization outputs that demonstrate both the effectiveness of the optimization approach and provide actionable insights for urban transportation planning. The following analysis examines four key visualization sets that capture the system's performance across all optimization dimensions.

### 1. PyMOO Optimization Results: Multi-Objective Success

<img src="https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject/CitiBikeModelingSystem/figures/pymoo_optimization_results.png" alt="PyMOO Optimization Results" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>

The **Station Location Pareto Front** (left panel) demonstrates the fundamental trade-off between population coverage and total cost that defines optimal station placement. The evolutionary algorithm successfully identified multiple optimal solutions ranging from cost-effective coverage (40,000+ people covered) to budget-conscious approaches. Key insights include:

- **Pareto Efficiency**: The clear upward trend confirms that higher population coverage requires proportionally higher investment, with no "free lunch" solutions
- **Sweet Spot Identification**: The knee of the curve around 50,000 population coverage represents the optimal balance point for most planning scenarios
- **Decision Flexibility**: Multiple solutions along the Pareto front enable planners to choose based on budget constraints and policy priorities

The **PyMOO Price Optimization Results** (right panel) reveal sophisticated pricing dynamics that balance revenue generation with equity considerations:

- **Annual Pass Optimization**: The dramatic difference between current ($180.00) and optimal ($199.95) annual pass pricing suggests significant revenue potential through strategic pricing
- **Single Ride Stability**: Minimal changes to single ride pricing ($4.95 to $6.67) indicate this segment is near optimal for accessibility
- **Day Pass Strategy**: Moderate adjustment ($15.00 to $22.50) reflects the middle ground between casual user accessibility and revenue maximization

**Policy Implication**: The pricing optimization maintains equity constraints (Gini coefficient ≤ 0.30) while identifying $2.8M+ annual revenue potential through strategic fare restructuring.

### 2. Rebalancing Analysis: Operational Intelligence

<img src="https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject/CitiBikeModelingSystem/figures/rebalancing_analysis.png" alt="Rebalancing Analysis" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>

The model performance visualization confirms the dramatic forecasting improvements achieved through enhanced feature engineering:

**Mean Absolute Error Distribution** (top-left): The concentration around $1.55 \operatorname{MAE}$ with tight distribution indicates:
- **Consistent Accuracy**: Most stations achieve similar prediction quality
- **System Reliability**: Low variance in error rates enables dependable planning

**R² Score Distribution** (top-right): The strong concentration around $0.871 \operatorname{R}^2$ represents:
- **Exceptional Predictive Power**: Models explain $85\%+$ of demand variance
- **Uniform Performance**: Consistent results across diverse station types

**MAE vs R² Correlation** (bottom-left): The scatter plot colored by sample size reveals:
- **Sample Size Impact**: Larger datasets (darker colors) generally achieve better performance
- **Performance Clustering**: Most stations cluster in the high-performance region ($R^2 > 0.85$, $\operatorname{MAE} < 1.6$)

**Performance Summary Table** (bottom-right): The quantified metrics validate the integrated approach:
- **Mean MAE: 1.550** - Represents $<2$ trips/hour average error
- **Mean R²: 0.871** - Demonstrates $85\%$ variance explanation
- **20 Models Trained** - Confirms comprehensive station coverage

**Technical Achievement**: These results represent a 235% improvement over baseline forecasting ($R^2$ from 0.260 to 0.871), validating the sophisticated feature engineering approach.

### 4. Demand Patterns Analysis: Urban Dynamics Captured

<img src="https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject/CitiBikeModelingSystem/figures/demand_patterns_analysis.png" alt="Demand Patterns Analysis" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>

The demand patterns visualization reveals sophisticated understanding of urban mobility dynamics:

**Hourly Demand by Station Type** (top-left): Clear differentiation between commuter, tourist, and mixed stations:
- **Commuter Stations**: Sharp morning ($7-8$ AM) and evening ($5-7$ PM) peaks reflecting work schedules
- **Tourist Stations**: Broader midday peaks ($10$ AM-$4$ PM) with sustained evening activity
- **Mixed Stations**: Combination patterns providing system flexibility

**Weekday vs Weekend Patterns** (top-right): Distinct temporal profiles validate the weekend interaction features:
- **Weekday Pattern**: Clear bimodal distribution with pronounced rush hours
- **Weekend Pattern**: More distributed demand with later morning starts and sustained evening activity

**Temperature Impact Analysis** (bottom-left): The temperature-demand relationship with overlay trend line shows:
- **Optimal Range**: Peak demand occurs in the $65-75\degree \operatorname{F}$ range
- **Weather Sensitivity**: Dramatic demand increases with comfortable temperatures
- **Seasonal Planning**: Critical for capacity planning across climate variations

**Station-Specific Forecasts** (bottom-right): Individual station predictions demonstrate:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Each station shows unique but predictable demand curves
- **Model Differentiation**: Station $\operatorname{S}000$, $\operatorname{S}001$, and $\operatorname{S}002$ display distinct behavioral patterns
- **Forecast Reliability**: Smooth, realistic prediction curves indicate model stability

**Urban Planning Insight**: These patterns confirm that the integrated approach successfully captures the complex interplay between temporal, spatial, weather, and behavioral factors that drive urban bike-sharing demand.

### Integrated Visualization Impact

Collectively, these visualizations demonstrate that the comprehensive mathematical modeling approach achieves its core objectives:

1. **Predictive Accuracy**: $87\%$ demand variance explanation enables reliable planning
2. **Operational Efficiency**: $0.033+$ bikes/km rebalancing efficiency with targeted interventions
3. **Strategic Optimization**: Pareto-optimal solutions balancing coverage, cost, and equity
4. **Urban Understanding**: Sophisticated capture of temporal, spatial, and behavioral patterns

The visualization suite provides transportation planners with unprecedented insight into system dynamics, enabling data-driven decisions that serve more people, reduce costs, and improve sustainability outcomes. Most importantly, the interpretable nature of all visualizations ensures that complex optimization results remain accessible to stakeholders and decision-makers across the urban planning ecosystem.
