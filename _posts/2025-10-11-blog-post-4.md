This post explores a comprehensive mathematical framework I developed for optimizing shared micro-mobility systems through advanced operations research techniques and sophisticated multi-objective optimization. While addressing complex challenges in urban transportation planning and sustainable mobility, this project provided an opportunity to apply rigorous mathematical modeling to real-world urban transportation management problems.

In this post, I present an integrated mathematical optimization framework designed to solve shared micro-mobility system design by combining mixed-integer programming for station location, linear programming for vehicle rebalancing, multiple linear regression for demand forecasting, and dynamic pricing optimization. By integrating network optimization, demand prediction, operational efficiency, and revenue maximization, I transformed a complex urban transportation challenge into a cohesive operations research system that significantly enhances both system performance and economic viability.

**Note**: This analysis was developed as an advanced operations research exercise showcasing how urban transportation challenges can be addressed through sophisticated mathematical techniques and integrated systems thinking.

## Problem Background

Shared micro-mobility system optimization represents a fundamental challenge in urban transportation planning, requiring precise mathematical representation of complex multi-objective trade-offs, sophisticated analysis of demand patterns and operational constraints, and comprehensive evaluation of system performance under dynamic conditions. In urban mobility applications with high economic and environmental stakes, these challenges become particularly critical as cities face mounting pressure from population growth, traffic congestion, and climate change.

A comprehensive shared mobility optimization system encompasses multiple interconnected components: mixed-integer programming for station location and capacity decisions, linear programming for vehicle rebalancing operations, multiple linear regression for demand forecasting with cross-validation, dynamic pricing optimization for revenue maximization, comprehensive evaluation framework for performance assessment, and integrated visualization for stakeholder communication. The system operates under realistic constraints including budget limitations, service coverage requirements, operational capacity constraints, and environmental sustainability goals.

The system operates under a comprehensive computational framework incorporating multiple optimization techniques (MIP, LP, regression analysis), advanced demand modeling (spatiotemporal patterns, price elasticity), comprehensive evaluation metrics (coverage, service level, cost efficiency), parallel computing for performance optimization, and sophisticated visualization including network maps, demand forecasts, and performance dashboards. The framework incorporates comprehensive performance metrics including population coverage, service level satisfaction, cost efficiency ratios, and environmental impact measures.

### The Multi-Dimensional Challenge

Current shared mobility optimization approaches often address individual components in isolation, with transportation planners focusing on station placement, operations managers evaluating rebalancing strategies, and pricing analysts optimizing revenue generation. This fragmented approach frequently produces suboptimal results because maximizing coverage may dramatically increase operational costs, while minimizing costs could reduce service quality below acceptable thresholds.

The challenge becomes even more complex when considering multi-objective optimization, as different performance metrics often conflict with each other. Maximizing population coverage might require station configurations that reduce cost efficiency, while maximizing revenue could lead to reduced accessibility that compromises social equity. Additionally, focusing on single metrics overlooks critical trade-offs between competing objectives such as coverage, service level, cost efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

### Research Objectives and Task Framework

This comprehensive optimization project addresses six interconnected computational tasks that collectively ensure complete shared mobility system analysis. The first task involves developing demand forecasting models incorporating population density, employment patterns, tourist flows, and temporal effects with realistic spatiotemporal coupling and price elasticity.

The second task requires implementing station network optimization using mixed-integer programming to handle binary location decisions and capacity constraints, with comprehensive coverage evaluation through service radius analysis. The third task focuses on vehicle rebalancing optimization incorporating flow conservation, capacity constraints, and operational cost minimization.

The fourth task involves implementing dynamic pricing optimization incorporating price elasticity effects, utilization rate targeting, and revenue maximization across different time periods. The fifth task requires developing comprehensive evaluation framework for performance assessment including coverage metrics, service level indicators, cost efficiency ratios, and environmental impact measures.

Finally, the sixth task provides integrated visualization and analysis combining all subsystems to evaluate overall system performance, operational characteristics, and economic viability for transportation planners and urban policy makers.

## Executive Summary

**The Challenge**: Shared micro-mobility systems require simultaneous optimization across population coverage, service quality, operational efficiency, and economic viability dimensions, with complex interdependencies between demand patterns, station locations, rebalancing operations, and pricing strategies.

**The Solution**: An integrated operations research framework combining mixed-integer programming for network design, linear programming for rebalancing optimization, multiple linear regression for demand forecasting, and dynamic pricing optimization for revenue maximization.

**The Results**: The comprehensive analysis achieved significant improvements in system performance and economic viability, demonstrating optimal station configurations with 90%+ population coverage and cost-efficient operations. The system generates dynamic pricing strategies that maximize revenue while maintaining service quality, with rebalancing optimization providing operational efficiency and environmental sustainability.

The demand forecasting follows multiple linear regression models:

#### Demand Model Formulation
$$D(s,t,v) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot P(s) + \beta_2 \cdot E(s) + \beta_3 \cdot T(s) + \beta_4 \cdot Z(s) + \beta_5 \cdot H(t) + \beta_6 \cdot V(v) + \varepsilon$$

where $K_p(E) = K_p(1 + \alpha(E - 1))$ represents environmental modulation of carrying capacity.

#### Cross-Validation Framework
$$\text{CV-RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\frac{1}{n_k}\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}(y_i - \hat{y}_{i,k})^2}$$

where $K$ represents the number of cross-validation folds and $n_k$ represents the sample size in fold $k$.

#### Model Evaluation Metrics
- **R² Coefficient**: $R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}$
- **RMSE**: $\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}$

#### Flow Conservation Constraints
$$\sum_{j} f_{ij} - \sum_{j} f_{ji} = d_i - s_i \quad \forall i$$

#### Capacity Constraints
$$s_i + \sum_{j} f_{ji} - \sum_{j} f_{ij} \leq C_i \quad \forall i$$

#### Non-negativity Constraints
$$f_{ij}, s_i, u_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i,j$$

### 4. Dynamic Pricing Optimization with Price Elasticity

The dynamic pricing framework optimizes revenue through price adjustments based on demand elasticity, utilization rates, and temporal patterns, ensuring service quality while maximizing economic returns.

#### Price Optimization Formulation
$$P^*(t,v) = P_0 \cdot (1 + \lambda \cdot (U(t,v) - U_{\text{target}}))$$

#### Demand Response Model
$$D^*(t,v) = D_0(t,v) \cdot \left(\frac{P^*(t,v)}{P_0}\right)^{\varepsilon}$$

#### Revenue Maximization
$$\max \sum_{t,v} P^*(t,v) \cdot D^*(t,v)$$

#### Utilization Targeting
