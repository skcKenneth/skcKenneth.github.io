As climate variability intensifies and urbanization reshapes contact networks, a central modeling question becomes unavoidable:

> **How do temperature-driven mosquito dynamics interact with spatial spread and vaccination allocation to shape dengue burden over multi-year horizons?**

This post presents a **technical walkthrough** of the `dengue_climate_model` project: the mathematical model (with derivations), the numerical scheme and verification checks, and a deep interpretation of the generated visualizations and experiment-matrix summaries.

All figures shown here are generated by deterministic runs committed to the `dengue_climate_model/results/` folder.

## What this project implements (one-paragraph overview)

`dengue_climate_model` simulates a **spatiotemporal dengue system** over a 2D domain using:

- **Humans**: a spatial SEIRV-type system (with waning immunity), extended to split susceptibles into **never infected** vs **previously infected** so “ever infected fraction” is well-defined.
- **Mosquito ecology**: a temperature-dependent equilibrium of a 2-stage (aquatic/adult) system, used to compute a **suitability field** $\rho(T)$ that scales mosquito abundance.
- **Spatial movement**: diffusion for all human compartments and an additional **fat-tailed nonlocal dispersal** operator for exposed and infectious humans.
- **Vaccination**: daily-dose constraints and allocation strategies (`uniform`, `high_density`, `climate_adaptive`) producing a spatial vaccination-rate field $\nu(x,t)$.
- **Diagnostics**: a scalar $R_0(T,\nu)$ and a spatial field $R_0(x,t)$ for interpretation and strategy targeting.

---

## Mathematical problem statement

Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a square spatial domain, discretized into an $n\times n$ grid. Human state variables are densities (counts per cell) evolving over time $t$ (days). We write the model in continuous form first, then explain the discretization and time stepping.

### State variables (humans)

We use a **history-split** susceptible/vaccinated structure:

- $S_0(x,t)$: never-infected susceptible humans
- $S_1(x,t)$: previously-infected susceptible humans (entering from waning immunity)
- $E(x,t)$: exposed (latent) humans
- $I(x,t)$: infectious humans
- $R(x,t)$: recovered/immune humans
- $V_0(x,t)$: vaccinated, never infected
- $V_1(x,t)$: vaccinated, previously infected

Total humans in a cell:  

$$
N(x) = S_0 + S_1 + E + I + R + V_0 + V_1
$$


In the implementation, $N(x)$ is fixed from a synthetic population density surface, and births balance natural deaths to keep global population approximately constant.

### State variables (mosquito infection)

We track infected adult mosquitoes $I_m(x,t)$. Total adult mosquito abundance $M(x,t)$ is treated as **quasi-equilibrated to temperature** (see derivation below), and **not** evolved dynamically as a state variable in the PDE. Instead, at each time step we compute:

$$
M(x,t) = m_0\, \rho(T(x,t)) \, N(x)
$$

where $m_0$ is a baseline mosquito-to-human ratio at peak suitability.

The susceptible mosquito pool is $S_m(x,t) = \max(M(x,t) - I_m(x,t), 0)$.

---

## Climate forcing: the temperature field $T(x,t)$

The model uses a temperature field composed of:


$$
T(x,t) = T_{\text{mean}} + \Delta T_{\text{climate}} + A \cos\!\left(\frac{2\pi (t - t_{\text{peak}})}{365}\right) + \delta T_{\text{spatial}}(x)
$$


- $T_{\text{mean}}$: baseline mean temperature (°C)
- $A$: seasonal amplitude (°C)
- $t_{\text{peak}}$: day-of-year peak timing
- $\Delta T_{\text{climate}}$: scenario warming offset (0, +1.5, +2.5°C)
- $\delta T_{\text{spatial}}(x)$: deterministic, mean-zero spatial anomaly (gradient / bumps / mixed)

The ablations used in the experiment matrix are implemented via two booleans:

- `enable_seasonality` toggles the cosine term.
- `enable_spatial_heterogeneity` toggles $\delta T_{\text{spatial}}$.

---

## Temperature-dependent mosquito ecology (with derivation)

The project defines temperature-dependent mosquito demographic rates:

- Egg laying $\theta(T)$ (Gaussian around an optimum)
- Maturation $\sigma(T)$ (piecewise linear, 0 outside [15, 35]°C)
- Aquatic mortality $\mu_A(T)$ (exponential)
- Adult mortality $\mu_M(T)$ (exponential + heat penalty above 35°C)

### Two-stage mosquito system

Let $A(t)$ be aquatic-stage mosquitoes and $M(t)$ be adult mosquitoes. The model uses:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dA}{dt} &= \theta(T) M - \big(\sigma(T) + \mu_A(T)\big)A - \frac{A^2}{K_A}\\
\frac{dM}{dt} &= \sigma(T)A - \mu_M(T)M
\end{aligned}
$$

### Analytic equilibrium $(A^*, M^*)$

At equilibrium, $\frac{dM}{dt}=0$ gives:

$$
M^* = \frac{\sigma(T)}{\mu_M(T)} A^*
$$

Substitute into $\frac{dA}{dt}=0$:

$$
0 = \theta(T)\frac{\sigma(T)}{\mu_M(T)}A^* - \big(\sigma(T)+\mu_A(T)\big)A^* - \frac{(A^*)^2}{K_A}
$$

Factor out $A^*$:

$$
0 = A^\* \left[\theta(T)\frac{\sigma(T)}{\mu_M(T)} - \big(\sigma(T)+\mu_A(T)\big) - \frac{A^\*}{K_A}\right]
$$

So either $A^*=0$ (extinction) or:

$$
\frac{A^*}{K_A} = \theta(T)\frac{\sigma(T)}{\mu_M(T)} - \big(\sigma(T)+\mu_A(T)\big)
$$

Define the net “growth surplus” term:

$$
g(T) = \theta(T)\frac{\sigma(T)}{\mu_M(T)} - \big(\sigma(T)+\mu_A(T)\big)
$$

Then:

$$
A^*(T) = K_A \max(g(T),0),\qquad
M^*(T) = \frac{\sigma(T)}{\mu_M(T)} A^*(T)
$$

This is exactly what the code computes in `src/dengue_model.py` (`solve_mosquito_equilibrium()`), which makes the full simulation vastly faster than numerically integrating mosquito ODEs.

### Suitability $\rho(T)$

Suitability is a normalized proxy:

$$
\rho(T)=\frac{M^\*(T)}{M^\*(T_{\text{ref}})}
$$

clipped to $[0,1]$. In the code, $T_{\text{ref}} = T_{\text{opt}}$ (the egg-laying optimum).

---

## Transmission coupling and force of infection

### Temperature-driven biting and transmission rates

The temperature-dependent biting rate is:

$$
b(T) =
\begin{cases}
b_0 \exp(k_b(T-25)), & 15\le T\le 35\\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

The project then defines (scalar form):

- Mosquito-to-human coupling proxy:

$$
\beta_h(T,M,N_h) = b(T)\,\alpha\,p_h\,\frac{M}{N_h}
$$

- Human-to-mosquito coupling:

$$
\beta_m(T) = b(T)\,p_m
$$

These are implemented in `beta_h()` and `beta_m()` and their vectorized equivalents.

### Human infection term (as implemented)

In the simulation loop, the new-exposure flux is computed as:

$$
\lambda_h(x,t) = \beta_h(T(x,t),M(x,t),N(x))\,\frac{S(x,t)\,I_m(x,t)}{N(x)}
$$

where $S = S_0 + S_1$.

This is a deliberately simplified “mass-action” scaling used for synthetic experiments; it is consistent with the code path in `run_simulation()` where `beta_h_field` already contains $\frac{M}{N}$ and the infection term divides by $N$ again.

### Mosquito infection term

Mosquito infection is modeled as SI over a fixed adult abundance field $M(x,t)$:

$$
\frac{dI_m}{dt} = \beta_m(T)\,\frac{S_m(x,t)\,I(x,t)}{N(x)} - \mu_M(T)\,I_m(x,t)
$$

with $S_m = \max(M-I_m,0)$.

---

## Human PDE system (reaction + diffusion + nonlocal dispersal)

### Reaction terms (ODE part)

Let $\nu(x,t)$ be the per-day vaccination rate applied to susceptibles (allocated subject to a dose budget). Births balance deaths with:

$$
\Lambda(x) = \mu_h N(x)
$$

Then the **history-split** human dynamics are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial S_0}{\partial t} &= \Lambda - \lambda_{h,0} - (\mu_h+\nu)S_0\\
\frac{\partial S_1}{\partial t} &= \omega R - \lambda_{h,1} - (\mu_h+\nu)S_1\\
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} &= \lambda_h - (\mu_h+\sigma_h)E\\
\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} &= \sigma_h E - (\mu_h+\gamma_h)I\\
\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} &= \gamma_h I - (\mu_h+\omega)R\\
\frac{\partial V_0}{\partial t} &= \nu S_0 - \mu_h V_0\\
\frac{\partial V_1}{\partial t} &= \nu S_1 - \mu_h V_1
\end{aligned}
$$

with $\lambda_{h,0}$ and $\lambda_{h,1}$ applying the same infection functional form separately to $S_0$ and $S_1$.

### Diffusion (local mixing)

Each human compartment receives a diffusion term:

$$
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}\Big|_{\text{diff}} = D_U \nabla^2 U
$$

with no-flux (Neumann) boundaries. In the code, the 5-point Laplacian uses edge padding.

### Nonlocal dispersal (fat-tailed mixing) for $E$ and $I$

Exposed and infectious humans also receive a nonlocal dispersal operator:

$$
\mathcal{L}[u](x) = \int_{\Omega} K(y)\,[u(x-y)-u(x)]\,dy
$$

implemented as:

$$
\mathcal{L}[u] \approx (K * u) - \left(\int K\right)u
$$

The kernel is a normalized fat-tailed distribution with scale $L$ and mass $\kappa$:

$$
K(r) \propto \left(1+\frac{r^2}{L^2}\right)^{-3/2}
$$

This construction makes $\sum_x \mathcal{L}[u](x)\approx 0$, i.e., **mass-conserving redistribution** (validated in unit tests).

---

## $R_0(T,\nu)$ and the spatial $R_0(x,t)$ field

### Scalar $R_0(T,\nu)$

The project uses a simplified next-generation form:

$$
R_0(T,\nu)=\sqrt{\frac{\beta_h(T)\,\beta_m(T)\,\sigma_h\,f_{\text{susc}}(\nu)}{(\mu_h+\sigma_h)(\mu_h+\gamma_h)\,\mu_M(T)}}
$$

with a vaccination adjustment factor:

$$
f_{\text{susc}}(\nu)=1-\frac{\nu}{\mu_h+\nu}\in[0,1]
$$

This is not intended as a full mechanistic vector-borne $R_0$ derivation (e.g., it omits explicit mosquito incubation), but rather a **consistent scalar proxy** used for strategy targeting and interpretability.

### Field $R_0(x,t)$

The field version vectorizes the same idea but uses local $M(x,t)/N(x)$ and local temperature:

$$
R_0(x,t)=\sqrt{\frac{\beta_h(x,t)\,\beta_m(x,t)\,\sigma_h\,f_{\text{susc}}(\nu(x,t))}{(\mu_h+\sigma_h)(\mu_h+\gamma_h)\,\mu_M(T(x,t))}}
$$

It is used in the visualization panels and in `climate_adaptive` vaccination allocation.

---

## Vaccination allocation: turning doses into $\nu(x,t)$

Daily dose budget is:

$$
D_{\text{day}} = \frac{D_{\text{annual}}}{365}
$$

We allocate doses as “people vaccinated per day per cell,” proportional to weights $w(x)$, then convert to a per-day vaccination rate:

$$
\text{alloc}(x) = D_{\text{day}}\frac{w(x)}{\sum_y w(y)},\qquad
\nu(x)=\min\!\left(\nu_{\max},\frac{\text{alloc}(x)}{S(x)+\varepsilon}\right)
$$

Weights differ by strategy:

- `uniform`: $w(x)=S(x)$
- `high_density`: $w(x)=\text{dens}(x)\,S(x)$
- `climate_adaptive`: $w(x)=\max(R_0(x,t)-1,0)\,S(x)$ (fallbacks to $S$ if all weights are zero)

---

## Numerical method and verification (what makes the synthetic story credible)

### Operator splitting (what actually runs)

Each time step $dt$ uses:

1. **Reaction step**: RK4 on the stacked state $[S_0,S_1,E,I,R,V_0,V_1,I_m]$.
2. **Incidence accumulation**: update `cumulative_cases` from the beginning-of-step infection rate (monotone by construction).
3. **Diffusion step**: explicit Euler for each human compartment.
4. **Nonlocal dispersal** (if $\kappa>0$): FFT convolution for $E$ and $I$.
5. **Projection**: clamp to non-negative; enforce global population conservation by renormalization (and hard-fail if drift is too large).

### Verification evidence (dt and grid refinement)

The script `verify_numerics.py` produces a report and comparison plot:

- Report: `results/verification-baseline-uniform-20251226-184346/verification_report.json`
- Plot: `results/verification-baseline-uniform-20251226-184346/verification_totals.png`

In that verification run (180-day horizon), the refinement comparisons are small:

- **dt refinement (1.0 → 0.5 days)**:
  - $\mathrm{rel}_{L2}(I_h(t)) \approx 1.19\times10^{-3}$
  - relative diff in final cumulative infections per capita $\approx 1.37\times10^{-3}$
- **grid refinement (20 → 30)**:
  - $\mathrm{rel}_{L2}(I_h(t)) \approx 1.87\times10^{-3}$
  - relative diff in final cumulative infections per capita $\approx 1.45\times10^{-4}$
This is the kind of “numerical sanity” evidence a methods-oriented blog (and later paper) needs: not a full convergence proof, but a concrete check that key totals are not artifacts of a particular discretization choice.

## Visualization deep dive (how to read the figures)

This project’s plots are designed so that *color is comparable across time points*:

- Prevalence is plotted on a log scale: $\log_{10}(I_h/N_h)$.
- Temperature $T$ and $R_0$ share fixed color limits across the four snapshots shown.
- Vaccination $\nu(x,t)$ is plotted as a fourth row (or population density if $\nu$ is absent).

### 1) Baseline spatiotemporal panel: what the rows mean

**Baseline (uniform)**:
![Spatiotemporal evolution (baseline, uniform)](https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject/dengue_climate_model/results/run-baseline-uniform-20251226-183901/spatiotemporal.png)

How to read it:

- **Row 1 (log10 prevalence)**: the outbreak seed at $t=0$ becomes a spatially spreading prevalence field. The log scale is essential: it lets you see both the dense core and the low-prevalence “halo” created by diffusion + fat-tailed dispersal.
- **Row 2 (T)**: fixed color scaling makes seasonality immediately visible (cool season vs warm season) without misleading per-panel auto-rescaling. You can now compare “same color means same temperature” across all columns.
- **Row 3 (R0)**: this is a mechanistic *proxy layer*: it is temperature-driven and modulated by vaccination. Spatial heterogeneity is controlled by $\delta T_{\text{spatial}}(x)$ and the population field via the $M/N$ scaling.
- **Row 4 (nu)**: uniform strategy allocates doses proportional to susceptibles, which—given the model’s mixing—often produces a near-uniform $\nu$ field after normalization and clipping. This row becomes more informative under `high_density` and `climate_adaptive` strategies.

### 2) Strategy comparison at the same scenario

Below are the curated spatiotemporal plots for the other strategies (same baseline climate):

![Spatiotemporal evolution (baseline, high_density)](https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject/dengue_climate_model/results/run-baseline-high_density-20251226-183924/spatiotemporal.png)

![Spatiotemporal evolution (baseline, climate_adaptive)](https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject/dengue_climate_model/results/run-baseline-climate_adaptive-20251226-184140/spatiotemporal.png)

What changes to look for:

- **$\nu(x,t)$ structure**:
  - `high_density` produces the cleanest spatial signal: vaccination concentrates in the urban core (bottom row), creating a visibly localized intervention footprint.
  - `climate_adaptive` is more subtle in this baseline run because the spatial $R_0(x,t)$ field is only moderately heterogeneous; you mainly see a weak large-scale gradient in $\nu$, plus seasonal modulation.
- **$R_0(x,t)$ response to intervention**:
  - In `high_density`, the strong $\nu$ hotspot locally suppresses $f_{\text{susc}}(\nu)$, which shows up as a depressed $R_0$ region colocated with the intervention footprint (third row).
  - This is exactly the *mechanistic chain* we want a reader to see: $T(x,t)\Rightarrow b(T),\mu_M(T),\rho(T)\Rightarrow M(x,t)\Rightarrow R_0(x,t)\Rightarrow \nu(x,t)\Rightarrow$ altered epidemic spread.
- **Prevalence vs $\nu$**: the meaningful question is not “does the blob look different,” but whether targeted vaccination changes (i) peak prevalence, (ii) the spatial extent above a threshold, and (iii) the timing and amplitude of recurrent seasonal pulses.

### 3) Temporal diagnostics: avoiding misleading “attack rate”

The temporal dashboard shows:

- Total infected humans over time (seasonal epidemic pulses)
- Average $R_0$ over time (temperature-driven transmissibility proxy)
- Average temperature over time
- **Burden metrics**:
  - `cumulative_infections_per_capita` (can exceed 1 with reinfection)
  - `ever_infected_fraction` (bounded in $[0,1]$, interpretable as “fraction ever infected at least once” among alive humans)
  - `ever_infected_proxy` ($(E+I+R)/N$, can decrease with waning)

![Temporal dynamics (baseline, uniform)](https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject/dengue_climate_model/results/run-baseline-uniform-20251226-183901/temporal.png)

For context, here are the same temporal dashboards for the other two strategies:

![Temporal dynamics (baseline, high_density)](https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject/dengue_climate_model/results/run-baseline-high_density-20251226-183924/temporal.png)

![Temporal dynamics (baseline, climate_adaptive)](https://skckenneth.github.io/ScienceProject/dengue_climate_model/results/run-baseline-climate_adaptive-20251226-184140/temporal.png)

Key interpretation:

- If you see cumulative infections per capita rising above 1, that is **not a bug** in this model: it is a direct consequence of **waning immunity $R\to S_1$** allowing reinfections.
- The ever-infected fraction is the correct “unique burden” metric in this framework and should be used for any statement resembling “attack rate” in a paper/blog context.
- The near-overlap of the three strategy curves in these baseline settings is also informative: with high mixing and moderate spatial heterogeneity, the allocation rule has limited leverage unless the dose constraint is tighter or the risk landscape is sharper (e.g., stronger $\delta T_{\text{spatial}}$, different mobility regime, or different population clustering).

## Experiment matrix: mechanisms and ablations (with numbers)

The experiment matrix run used for the tables/figures in this post is:

- `results/experiment-matrix-20251226-184353/summary.csv`
- tables: `blog_table_main.md`, `blog_table_ablations.md`
- figures: `blog_matrix_incidence.png`, `blog_ablation_cipc.png`

### Main table: scenario × strategy (seasonal+spatial forcing, both mixing operators)

| scenario | strategy | annual_incidence_per_100k | final_cumulative_infections_per_capita | final_ever_infected_fraction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| baseline | climate_adaptive | 111419 | 1.09893 | 0.978085 |
| baseline | high_density | 113335 | 1.11783 | 0.978781 |
| baseline | uniform | 111630 | 1.10101 | 0.97817 |
| warming1p5 | climate_adaptive | 115428 | 1.13846 | 0.977249 |
| warming1p5 | high_density | 116692 | 1.15094 | 0.9777 |
| warming1p5 | uniform | 115448 | 1.13866 | 0.977247 |
| warming2p5 | climate_adaptive | 115410 | 1.13829 | 0.972938 |
| warming2p5 | high_density | 116514 | 1.14918 | 0.973588 |
| warming2p5 | uniform | 115409 | 1.13828 | 0.972902 |

Interpretation notes:

- For these synthetic settings, warming shifts incidence and cumulative burden upward (not strictly monotone in every metric due to temperature nonlinearity and seasonality phase).
- Strategy effects exist but are modest at this coarse grid/horizon; that’s a useful “methods lesson”: **you need heterogeneity + a binding dose constraint to see strong spatial targeting benefits**.

### Ablation slice: forcing and mixing (baseline, uniform strategy)

| mixing | forcing | annual_incidence_per_100k | final_cumulative_infections_per_capita | r0_hotspot_fraction_mean |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| both | none | 117275 | 1.15669 | 0.153846 |
| both | seasonal+spatial | 111630 | 1.10101 | 0.153846 |
| both | seasonal_only | 111650 | 1.10121 | 0.153846 |
| both | spatial_only | 117005 | 1.15402 | 0.153846 |
| diffusion_only | none | 113793 | 1.12234 | 0.230769 |
| diffusion_only | seasonal+spatial | 109416 | 1.07917 | 0.230769 |
| diffusion_only | seasonal_only | 109549 | 1.08048 | 0.230769 |
| diffusion_only | spatial_only | 113476 | 1.11921 | 0.230769 |
| dispersal_only | none | 116520 | 1.14924 | 0.153846 |
| dispersal_only | seasonal+spatial | 109488 | 1.07988 | 0.153846 |
| dispersal_only | seasonal_only | 109272 | 1.07775 | 0.153846 |
| dispersal_only | spatial_only | 116120 | 1.14529 | 0.153846 |

The high-level mechanism takeaway:

- In this setup, “seasonal forcing” and “seasonal+spatial forcing” look similar in aggregated annual metrics because the **seasonal amplitude dominates** (and spatial anomaly is moderate). Turning seasonality off changes the burden substantially.
- The mixing ablation (`diffusion_only` vs `dispersal_only`) changes how infections occupy space, which feeds back into totals via spatially varying temperature and vaccination.

## Limitations (what remains before a journal submission)

This project is now in a strong **methods-paper** shape for synthetic analysis, but a reviewer will still ask for:

1. **Clearer mechanistic calibration** of the mosquito–human coupling terms (especially the scaling of human incidence with mosquito infection density and the choice of normalizations).
2. **Sensitivity and uncertainty**: which parameters dominate qualitative outcomes (already scaffolded via Sobol), and how robust results are to forcing structure.
3. **Validation**: even for a synthetic paper, some anchoring against literature ranges (e.g., $R_0(T)$ targets) and plausibility checks for incidence scales.
4. **Figure narrative**: for publication, each figure needs a single clear claim, plus supporting diagnostics in supplement.

If you want, the next step after this blog is to extract this content into a `paper/manuscript.md` skeleton and iteratively refine the coupling assumptions + ablations so each figure makes one strong, defensible scientific point.
