This is a blog post about the 2021 MCM Problem B on modeling fungal decomposition of woody fibers.

**Problem Background**
======================
Lake Mead, the largest water reservoir in the United States, is facing an unprecedented crisis. Located on the Nevada-Arizona border, this crucial Colorado River reservoir has reached its lowest level since its creation in the 1930s. In the summer of 2021, Lake Mead's water level dropped to just 36% of its full capacity.

This alarming situation is the result of several factors:
- Prolonged drought exacerbated by climate change
- Increasing water demand from the 25 million people Lake Mead serves
- Reduced inflow from the Colorado River
- Continued water consumption and evaporation

The severity of the situation led the Bureau of Reclamation to declare the first-ever water shortage on the Colorado River in August 2021. This Tier 1 water shortage declaration results in reduced water deliveries to Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico, with agricultural communities being the first to feel the impacts.

As researchers and policymakers grapple with this crisis, they're exploring multiple avenues, including analyzing historical water level data, developing predictive models, and investigating potential solutions like wastewater recycling.

**Analysis**
=============
To address the Lake Mead drought problem, we need to develop mathematical models that can predict future water levels and assess the potential impact of solutions like wastewater recycling. Our analysis will focus on two key aspects:

## Factors Affecting Lake Mead's Water Volume:
The volume of water in Lake Mead is influenced by:
- Inflow: Primarily from the Colorado River (96%) and other tributaries
- Outflow: Water releases through dams and direct consumption
- Loss: Evaporation from the lake surface

One may express the relationship mathematically as follows:

$$
\Delta V = \text{Inflow} - \text{Outflow} - \text{Evaporation}
$$
- Inflow can be modeled using historical data and climate forecasts.
- Outflow is determined by water demand, environmental regulations, and hydroelectric power generation.
- Evaporation rates can be estimated based on historical weather data and lake surface area.
- The change in volume ($\Delta V$) over time will give us insights into the reservoir's water level trends.
- We can use time series analysis and predictive modeling to forecast future water levels under different scenarios.

## Modeling Water Levels:
We can develop two mathematical models to predict Lake Mead's water levels:
- **SARIMAX Model**: Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX) is a time series model that incorporates seasonal patterns, autocorrelation, and external factors like climate data. By fitting a SARIMAX model to historical water level data, we can forecast future water levels and assess the impact of inflow, outflow, and evaporation on the reservoir.
- **Structural Time Series**: Structural time series models decompose the observed data into trend, seasonal, and error components. By analyzing these components, we can identify patterns and make predictions about future water levels.

Using SARIMAX model for time series analysis problem, it can capture both trend and seasonality in the data. The model can be used to forecast future water levels based on historical data and external factors like climate forecasts. By analyzing the model's parameters and residuals, we can evaluate its accuracy and make informed decisions about water management strategies.

The general form of a SARIMAX model is given by:

$$
\text{SARIMAX}(p, d, q) \times (P, D, Q)_m
$$

where:
- $p$ is the autoregressive order: the number of lagged observations included in the model
- $d$ is the differencing order: the number of times the data is differenced to achieve stationarity
- $q$ is the moving average order: the number of lagged forecast errors included in the model
- $P, D, Q$ are the seasonal autoregressive, differencing, and moving average orders
- $m$ is the seasonal period (e.g., 12 for monthly data)

While on the other hand, the structural time series model can be expressed as:

$$
y_t = \mu_t + \gamma_t + \varepsilon_t
$$

where:
- $y_t$ is the observed data at time $t$
- $\mu_t$ is the trend component: captures the long-term changes in the data
- $\gamma_t$ is the seasonal component: captures the periodic fluctuations
- $\varepsilon_t$ is the error term: captures the random fluctuations
- By estimating the parameters of the trend and seasonal components, we can forecast future water levels and assess the impact of different factors on the reservoir.
