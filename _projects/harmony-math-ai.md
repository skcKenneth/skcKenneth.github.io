## Project Overview

HarmonyMath AI is an innovative Python application that bridges the gap between music and mathematics. It analyzes audio files to extract frequency components, detect harmonic relationships, and generate mathematical models of musical structures.

### Key Features

- **üé∂ Advanced Audio Analysis**: FFT analysis, harmonic detection, and chord recognition
- **üìä Interactive Visualizations**: Frequency spectrum plots and waveform comparisons  
- **üñ•Ô∏è Dual Interface**: Both command-line and web GUI options
- **üìÅ Export Capabilities**: Mathematical equations, analysis reports, and high-quality visualizations

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **NumPy/SciPy**: Numerical computations and signal processing
- **Librosa**: Audio analysis and feature extraction
- **Streamlit**: Web GUI framework
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization

### Mathematical Foundation

The project uses the Wave Superposition Model:

$$y(t) = \sum_{i} A_i \cdot \sin(2\pi f_i t + \phi_i)$$

Where each component represents amplitude, frequency, and phase of the musical signal.

### Sample Output

The system generates:
- Mathematical equations describing audio wave structures
- Frequency-to-note mappings using equal temperament
- Harmonic ratio analysis (octaves, fifths, etc.)
- Interactive spectrum visualizations
